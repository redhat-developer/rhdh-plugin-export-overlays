    The Entity Feedback plugin enables users to rate and provide feedback on catalog entities
    within Backstage. It helps teams understand how useful and accurate their catalog entries
    are by collecting structured user feedback.

    ## Key Features

    * **Flexible Rating Systems**: Choose between like/dislike toggles or 5-star ratings
    * **Feedback Collection**: Automatically prompt for detailed feedback on poor ratings
    * **Owner Dashboards**: Aggregated views showing ratings for owned entities
    * **Customizable Prompts**: Configure response categories and dialog text
    * **Rating Analytics**: View rating breakdowns and trends

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    This plugin consists of both frontend and backend components that work together.

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin

    ### Rating Variant

    Configure the rating style in `app-config.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    entityFeedback:
      ratings:
        - variant: starred  # or 'like-dislike' (default)
    ```

    ### Feedback Collection

    Customize feedback prompts:

    ```yaml
    entityFeedback:
      ratings:
        - requireResponse: true
          dialogTitle: "Help us improve"
          dialogResponses:
            - Incorrect information
            - Missing details
            - Outdated content
            - Other
    ```

    ### Mount Points

    The plugin provides several UI components:

    * **EntityLikeDislikeRatingsCard**: Rating buttons for entity pages
    * **EntityFeedbackResponseContent**: Feedback tab showing collected responses
    * **UserEntitiesRatingsCard**: Aggregated ratings for user/group pages

    ## Prerequisites

    * **Authentication Required**: This plugin requires user authentication. The guest identity
      provider is not supported as the plugin needs to identify who submitted each rating.
    * **Backend Plugin**: The backend plugin must be installed for the frontend to function.
    * **Notifications (Optional)**: Integrates with Backstage Notifications to alert entity
      owners of new feedback.

    For more detailed configuration instructions, see the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/blob/main/workspaces/entity-feedback/plugins/entity-feedback/README.md).
